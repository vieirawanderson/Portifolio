Research question:

Use of Hooke's spring law to create an animated physics-based liquid simulation of a droplet falling. 

Provide a description of the goals and objectives of your proposed Academic Training:

Goals:
Render a short animation of a liquid droplet falling on a surface of the same liquid using Hookeâ€™s law to simulate the reaction behavior. The simulation is based in adding a drop of liquid to a 'large' volume of liquid and observing how the surface of the large volume is displaced by the force of the droplet.

Objectives
The previously literature study had shown that physical interaction in liquids can have a high complexity and demand an exhaustive work to represent every variable according to the real physic phenomena. Thus, the main objective of the research is proof that this complex physical interaction can be simplified down to modeling the surface of the volume as a network of springs and dampeners. Moreover, the research approach general computer graphics and programming techniques knowledge.

The product behavior of the research is going to be an animation movie that last few seconds and simulate a single detailed droplet reaction beside surface. The outcome is going to show a 3D surface that reacts according to real singularities and keep looping showing it sequentially. Illumination and shading techniques will be applied to the animation to provide a better and convincing result. 

As secondary objective, the research seeks out a simplified understanding and application of the physical behavior of liquid dropping and its reactions using known equations to write an algorithm that render the animation. The equations are necessary to change the objects properties along the time and makes it looks like coherently with a real reaction.
