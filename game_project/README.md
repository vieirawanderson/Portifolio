Introduction: 
The game Riotization is a platform game with geometrical and structural

language. The universe is based in historic facts that approach riots around 
the world. This kind of popular manifestation usually has a controversial 
side and the game is going to tangent both sides: rioters and authorities.

and avoid be defeated by an opposite enemy.

different reasons. The demonstrations were initially organized to protest 
against several issues such high corruption and government intolerance, 
but as we usually can see, the government does not like to lose its control 
and the police brutality shows up against these demonstrators. Some people 
say that it is a disguised fascist. 
Some Television Networks have been banned and people does not know what is 
happening on the streets. 
As a militant you must to confront these acts and re-establish the communications 
to show the world the true face of this dirty government.

a) Formal elements

Goals:

forces between you and the parliament advancing around the policies barricades and defeating 
them when necessary.

Game challenges and conflicts between players

time to solve.

b) Non-formal elements
The player emotionally attached to the outcome
The outcomes become the gameplay more and more competitive, the background story makes 
people think about the both sides of every riot. 
Is there a sense of play within the rules of the game? What is fun about it?
The rules does not correspond with the reality, because everyone knows what happens 
when people try to confront the police. In this case the rules make the players realize 
how could be different if people had the same power than the authorities. Although many 
rules are different with the reality, the general idea make a simulation of a real 
confront. It makes the game funnier.
